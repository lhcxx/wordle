# Wordle Console Game

A C# console implementation of the popular Wordle game, featuring the same scoring rules as the original NYTimes Wordle game. The project includes both a standalone console version and a client/server architecture.

## Features

### Standalone Version
- **5-letter word guessing game** with the same rules as the original Wordle
- **Configurable word list** loaded from JSON file
- **Configurable maximum rounds** (default: 6 rounds)
- **Color-coded feedback** for each guess:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Hit (correct letter, correct position)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Present (correct letter, wrong position)  
  - âšª Gray: Miss (letter not in word)
- **Input validation** ensuring only valid 5-letter words are accepted
- **Win/Lose detection** based on maximum rounds

### Client/Server Version
- **TCP-based client/server architecture**
- **Multiple concurrent clients** supported
- **Server-side validation** and game logic
- **Client-side user interface** for input/output
- **Network communication** over TCP sockets
- **Session management** for each client

## Game Rules

1. The game randomly selects a 5-letter word from the configured word list
2. You have 6 attempts to guess the word
3. After each guess, you receive feedback:
   - **Hit (Green)**: Letter is in the correct position
   - **Present (Yellow)**: Letter is in the word but wrong position
   - **Miss (Gray)**: Letter is not in the word
4. You win if you guess the word within 6 attempts
5. You lose if you fail to guess the word after 6 attempts

## Architecture

### Standalone Mode
- Single console application
- All game logic runs locally
- Direct user interaction

### Client/Server Mode
- **Server**: Handles game logic, validation, and session management
- **Client**: Provides user interface and network communication
- **Network Protocol**: TCP-based communication
- **Security**: Server validates all inputs, client never knows the answer

## Configuration

### Word List
The game uses a JSON configuration file (`words.json`) containing 100 5-letter words. You can modify this file to add or change words.

### Maximum Rounds
The maximum number of rounds can be configured in the `GameConfiguration.cs` file by changing the `MaxRounds` property (default: 6).

### Network Settings
- **Default Port**: 8888
- **Default Server**: localhost
- **Protocol**: TCP

## How to Run

## Technical Details

### Standalone Mode
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Implements the exact same logic as the original Wordle game
- **Case Insensitive**: All words are converted to uppercase for comparison
- **Input Validation**: Ensures guesses are exactly 5 letters and exist in the word list
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to default words if configuration file is missing or corrupted
- **JSON Configuration**: Uses System.Text.Json for configuration management

### Client/Server Mode
- **Network Protocol**: TCP sockets for reliable communication
- **Session Management**: Each client gets a unique session with its own game state
- **Server-side Validation**: All input validation happens on the server
- **Concurrent Clients**: Server can handle multiple clients simultaneously
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Server handles Ctrl+C for clean shutdown
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network issues

## Security Features

### Client/Server Architecture
- **Answer Protection**: Client never receives the answer until game over
- **Server-side Validation**: All game logic and validation on server
- **Session Isolation**: Each client has independent game sessions
- **Input Sanitization**: Server validates all client inputs

## Customization

### Adding Words
To add your own words, edit the `words.json` file and add 5-letter words to the "Words" array. The game will automatically load the new word list on startup.

### Network Configuration
- **Change Port**: Modify the port number in `ServerProgram.cs` and `ClientProgram.cs`
- **Change Server Address**: Modify the server address in `ClientProgram.cs`
- **Firewall**: Ensure the server port is open in your firewall

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Refused**: Make sure the server is running before starting the client
2. **Port Already in Use**: Change the port number in the server configuration
3. **Firewall Issues**: Allow the application through your firewall
4. **Network Issues**: Check network connectivity between client and server
